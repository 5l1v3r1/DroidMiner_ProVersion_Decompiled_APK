Over the years I have cracked a lot of apps with the mythical Lucky Patcher,

and I've often wondered how his patches worked ...

One day I needed a miner for android and walking around the playstore I saw qyuesta that seemed valid, </BR>
but I needed the pro version to use different smarphones and workers, so I bought the app </BR>
and then I created an apk with the permits cracked via lucky patcher

Recently I shared the apk on youtube and of course some users have immediately thought about a malware....

But i think is also because if scanned on virus total 18 antivirus on 61 they detect it as malware </BR>
(most like Android: BitCoinMiner-R [PUP] or not- a-virus: HEUR: RiskTool.Linux.BitCoinMiner.ao </BR>
or other variants ... some even see it as a trojan) A little harsh :( :( :(

The funny thing is that if you try to scan the apk (find both files in the folder TESTS !!!) on total virus the file is infected for 18 vendors while if you scan the zip only 10 vendors detect it as malware, it is not the first time it happens, obviously some vendors have trouble detecting viruses with compressed format files...

So I took the opportunity to study a little apk and the code behind it, </BR>
and I disassembled the apk with a simple online service:

http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk

In this way I hope that: A people stop breaking my balls, and B that serves high to understand the operation of the crack on android.

If you need it, in the "TESTS !!" folder! find the apk file already compiled, of the pro version of Droid Miner.
With this version you can undermine different smartphone and use different workers.
Or if you prefer you can obviously compile it yourself (the funny way :) :) :))

And for the record: I tried to download the same apk on another site
and as many as 27 vendors on VirusTotal have detected it as malware!
