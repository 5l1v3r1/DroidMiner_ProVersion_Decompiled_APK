Over the years I have cracked a lot of apps with the mythical Lucky Patcher,

and I've often wondered how his patches worked ...

Recently I shared the apk on youtube and of course some users have immediately thought about a malware....

But i think is also because if scanned on virus total 18 antivirus on 61 they detect it as malware </BR>
(most like Android: BitCoinMiner-R [PUP] or not- a-virus: HEUR: RiskTool.Linux.BitCoinMiner.ao </BR>
or other variants ... some even see it as a trojan) A little harsh :( :( :(

The funny thing is that if you try to scan the apk (find both files in the folder TESTS !!!) on total virus the file is infected for 19 vendors while if you scan the zip only 10 vendors detect it as malware, it is not the first time it happens, obviously some vendors have trouble detecting viruses with compressed format files...

So I took the opportunity to study a little apk and the code behind it, >/BR>
and I disblowed the apk with a simple online service:
